# About Hyper

With the rise of Docker, the world is shifting its focus from "Machine" toward "App". As such, [the cloud of tomorrow](http://www.ibuildthecloud.com/blog/2014/08/19/containers-as-a-service-caas-is-the-cloud-operating-system/) will be very different than today.

When the future is exciting, what holding us is the lack of isolation in container. Without the necessary security, it is impossible for build a public multi-tenant CaaS platform,  as everyone have to share the single host kernel (no matter physical or virtual).

Hyper is a **Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Runtime**. The goal is to ***Make VM run like Container***, by combing the best from both:

- **Fast as Container**
- **Isolated by VM**

With Hyper, we believe that the future of Container-as-a-Service  is just around the corner.
